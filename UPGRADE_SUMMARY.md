## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Factual Query
```
User: "Who is the current CEO of Apple?"

System:
1. Analyzes: Factual query
2. Uses: wikipedia_summary
3. Verifies: High confidence (Wikipedia)
4. Responds: "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple Inc..."
   Source: Wikipedia
   Confidence: HIGH (95%)
```

### Example 2: Real-Time Data
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris and Apple stock price?"

System:
1. Analyzes: Two queries (weather + stock)
2. Uses: get_weather, get_stock_price (parallel)
3. Responds: Both pieces of data
   Sources: wttr.in, Yahoo Finance
   Confidence: HIGH (100%) - Real-time APIs
```

### Example 3: Complex Research
```
User: "How has climate change affected polar bears?"

System:
1. Decomposes into 5 sub-questions
2. Uses: wikipedia_search, web_search, scrape_webpage
3. Gathers information for each sub-question
4. Synthesizes comprehensive answer
5. Responds: Multi-paragraph answer with citations
   Sources: Wikipedia, Nature.com, NOAA, WWF
   Confidence: HIGH (85%) - Multiple authoritative sources
```

### Example 4: Error Recovery
```
User: "weather there"

System:
1. Attempts: get_weather with "there" ‚Üí fails
2. Generates helpful error:
   "I need a specific location. Try:
   - City name (e.g., 'weather in London')
   - City and country (e.g., 'Paris, France')
   - Major cities work best"
3. Never says "I can't"
```
