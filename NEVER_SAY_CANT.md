## üß† Advanced Reasoning System

### Query Analysis & Decomposition ([`reasoning.ts`](apps/server/src/reasoning.ts))

**1. Decompose Complex Queries**
```typescript
decomposeQuery(query: string) ‚Üí string[]
```
Breaks down complex, multi-part questions into simpler sub-questions that can be answered independently.

**Example:**
```
Input: "How has climate change affected polar bears and what solutions are proposed?"

Output:
1. What is climate change and how does it affect Arctic regions?
2. How do polar bears depend on Arctic ice?
3. What are the current polar bear population trends?
4. What is causing the decline?
5. What solutions are being proposed?
```

**2. Synthesize Information**
```typescript
synthesizeInformation(query, sources) ‚Üí string
```
Combines multiple pieces of information into one coherent, comprehensive answer with citations.

**3. Verify Facts**
```typescript
verifyFacts(claim, sources) ‚Üí { verified, confidence, explanation }
```
Cross-references claims against multiple sources to determine accuracy.

**4. Assess Confidence**
```typescript
assessConfidence(question, answer, sources) ‚Üí { confidence, reasoning, gaps }
```
Evaluates how confident we should be in an answer (0-100 scale).

## üéØ Intelligent Query Orchestration

### Automatic Tool Selection ([`orchestrator.ts`](apps/server/src/orchestrator.ts))

The system automatically analyzes each query and:

1. **Categorizes the query**
   - Weather, stocks, time, news, math, code, facts, comparisons, how-tos, explanations

2. **Selects appropriate tools**
   - Weather query ‚Üí `get_weather`
   - Stock query ‚Üí `get_stock_price`
   - Factual query ‚Üí `wikipedia_summary` + `web_search`
   - Current events ‚Üí `get_news` + `web_search`
   - Complex query ‚Üí Decompose + multiple tools

3. **Determines complexity**
   - Simple: Direct tool use
   - Moderate: Multiple tools in sequence
   - Complex: Decompose into sub-questions, orchestrate tools, synthesize results

4. **Provides helpful errors**
   - If something fails, gives specific guidance on how to rephrase
   - Suggests alternative approaches
   - Never leaves user without help

## üéì Enhanced System Prompt

### Core Principles ([`systemPrompts.ts`](apps/server/src/systemPrompts.ts))

The AI now operates under these absolute rules:

1. **NEVER SAY "I CAN'T"**
   - ‚ùå "I don't have access to..."
   - ‚ùå "I cannot..."
   - ‚ùå "I'm unable to..."
   - ‚ùå "I don't know..."
   - ‚úÖ "Let me search for that..."
   - ‚úÖ "I'll check multiple sources..."
   - ‚úÖ "Based on the latest data..."

2. **ACCURACY FIRST**
   - Always use tools to verify information
   - Never guess or make things up
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Cite sources for factual claims

3. **COMPREHENSIVE ANSWERS**
   - Address all parts of the query
   - Provide complete context
   - Include relevant details
   - Anticipate follow-up questions

4. **TRANSPARENCY**
   - Cite sources
   - Indicate confidence levels
   - Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists
   - Explain what was checked

5. **MULTI-TOOL ORCHESTRATION**
   - Use multiple tools when needed
   - Try alternatives if one fails
   - Combine information from various sources
   - Synthesize into coherent response
